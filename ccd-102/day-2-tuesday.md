- 4-8
- Knowledge Check
  - Controllers must conform to B2C Commerce module
standard
    - False, commerce module standard does not exist
    - Exam won't have intentionally trick questions like this
  - Middleware chaining allows you to extend routes
without having to rewrite them
    - True
- Model
  - Converts API objects to serializable JSON
  - Applies business logic during conversion, so data is in a usable format
    - e.g. Price may be affected by current promotions
- 5-1
  - All decorators can be imported at once by importing `decorators/index.js`
  - `module.superModule` and `base.call` allow for extending models without editing the base cart
- 5-2
  - Revisit later
- Extend a model with a new decorator
  - Revisit later
- Knowledge Check
  - How can you extend a model when no decorator
pattern is used?

  - Can you give another example for when you may want
to extend or create a new model?
    - Size guides for clothing products
- ISML
  - Internet Store Markup Language

  - .isml
- 6-1
  - Prophet's tag completion ignores starting brace
    - `issl` > `<isslot>`
    - `<issl` > `<<isslot>
  - Comments
    - HTML comments `<!-- -->` are sent to browser
    - ISML comments `<iscomment>` are never sent to browser
    - To comment out a script, use isml comments. HTML comments will not stop isscript from running
  - `<isscript` is not linted
  - Best Practice: Only use isscript to load client side css and js
    - Scripting should be done in controller, with output passed to template
  - `<isprint>`
    - Prints output, formated based on localization settings
- Template Decorator
  - Used to add headers and footers to page, similar to Shopify layout
  - `<isreplace/>` Replaced by page content
- Types of Template Decorators
  - Page
    - Includes navigation
  - Checkout
    - Does not include navigation
    - OOB, only used in checkout
- Best Practices for Other ISML Tags in SFRA
  - Control logic should take place in the controller, instead of isml templates
    - Exception: setting cache for content slots
      - Content slot controller is located SFCC server side, no access
- ISML Expressions
  - `${}`
- The Top Level Package
  - Implicitly included, never needs to be imported
  - Implicitly used, not mentioned in expressions
- The dw.web Package
  - Also implicitly included
- Creating and accessing variables
  - `<isset>`
    - Don't do business logic here
    - Attributes
      - name
      - value
      - scope
        - Recommended to use page, defaults to session
  - Retrieval syntax by scope
    - Included templates can retrieve variables if within scope
  - Variable Attributes
  - Conditional Statements and Loops
  - Loops
    - `<isloop>`
      - Loops through itemsin collection or array
      - Can break and continue  loops
  - Status Variable Properties
  - 6-4
  - Remote Includes
    - Never hard code URLs, use URLUtils to build url instead
      - URLs change depending on the server, each sandbox, staging, dev, and prod will have its own URLs
    - Remote include content can have different cache settings than the page it appears on
      - e.g. Search results/product tile order can't be cached, but the product tiles themselves can be
    - URLUtils.url will automatically try to route to `Start` if route is not included
      - `URLUtils.url('Basket')` == `URLUtils.url('Basket-Start')`
- Resource API and Resource Bundles
  - Used in place of hardcoded strings
  - Allows for i18n
  - `.properties` extension
  - Named by functional area
  - Located in `cartridges/${cart_name}/cartridge/templates/resources`
  - Fallback
    - ISO country codes are all caps
    - ISO lang codes are all lowercase
    - First, server looks in account_fr_FR.properties for key value pair (if present)
    - If not found, next account_fr.properties is checked (if present)
    - If not found, next account.properties is checked  (if present)
    - If not found, then it gives up
  - Add variables to translation
    - Values passed in, referenced by index
    - Key Value pair: `label.number.items.in.cart={0} Items`
    - Reference in model: `Resource.msgf('label.number.items.in.cart', 'cart', null, this.numItems)`
    - Result: `10 items`
- Using a Resource Bundle
  - `Resource.msg`
    - Used when there are no variables
    - `Resource.msg('key.in.resource.file', 'resource_file', 'default text')`
  - `Resource.msgf`
    - Used when there are variables
    - `Resource.msgf('key.in.resource.file', 'resource_file', 'default text', Parameter1)`
  - Use default text?
    - If used, prevents nonsense text from appearing on site
    - If not used, output text may erroneously pass QA because it appears correct

    - Global slot
      - `context="global"`

      - `context="category"`
      - `context-object="${pdict.category}"`
        - Pass current category into content slot
- Developer Creates a Slot Rendering Template
  - `slotcontent` belongs to `Toplevel.global`
